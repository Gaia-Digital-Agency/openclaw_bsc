# SKILL-BSC-REGISTER.md — WhatsApp Family Registration

This skill handles the full multi-turn WhatsApp registration flow.
It covers three distinct turns: (1) intent detected → send invite, (2) template received → validate and confirm, (3) YES received → submit to API.

---

## Trigger Phrases — Send Invite (Turn 1)

Trigger when sender says any of:
- "register", "sign up", "sign me up", "new account", "create account"
- "daftar", "daftar baru", "mau daftar"
- "how do I register", "how to register", "how to sign up"
- "I want to register", "I'd like to register"

Do NOT trigger if a registration state file already exists and is not expired — handle that case (see Stale File below).

---

## Trigger — Template Received (Turn 2)

Trigger when the message contains ALL of these markers:
- `Family or Group name`
- `Parent first name`
- `Email`
- `Password`
- `Student 1` or `--- Student`

---

## Trigger — Confirmation Reply (Turn 3)

Trigger when:
- Sender replies `YES` or `yes` or `Ya` or `ya` or `confirm`
- AND a valid non-expired state file exists at `/opt/.openclaw-bsc/memory/registration_{PHONE}.json`

Or cancel:
- Sender replies `NO` or `no` or `Tidak` or `cancel` or `batal`
- AND a state file exists

---

## School Resolution — Live Lookup (runtime)

Do NOT hardcode school UUIDs. At Turn 2 (template received), fetch the live school list:

```
curl -s https://schoolcatering.gaiada1.online/api/v1/auth/register/schools
```

Returns array of `{ id, name, city }`. Fuzzy match the parent's typed school name against the `name` field.

Fuzzy match rules:
- Case-insensitive, partial match is sufficient
- "BIS", "bali island", "bali" → Bali Island School
- "SIS", "sanur independent", "sanur" → Sanur Independent School
- Any future school added to the platform will be matched automatically
- No match → validation error (see Step 2 below)

---

## TURN 1 — Intent Detected: Send Invite

When registration intent is detected:

1. Check if sender is already registered:
   - GET `https://schoolcatering.gaiada1.online/api/v1/public/lookup-name?phone=SENDER_PHONE`
   - If `found: true` → reply:
     > You already have an account on Blossom School Catering. You can log in at https://blossomcatering.online/ 😊

2. If `found: false` → send the registration invite message:

```

## TURN 2 — Template Received: Parse, Validate, Confirm

### Step 1 — Fetch live school list

```
curl -s https://schoolcatering.gaiada1.online/api/v1/auth/register/schools
```

Store as `SCHOOL_LIST` for fuzzy matching in validation.

### Step 2 — Parse fields

Extract from the message:

**Parent fields:**
- `parentLastName` ← Family or Group name
- `parentFirstName` ← Parent first name
- `parentEmail` ← Email
- `password` ← Password
- `parentMobileNumber` ← Parent Phone (if blank, use SENDER_PHONE)

**Per student block** (repeat for each `--- Student N ---` block):
- `youngsterFirstName` ← First name
- `youngsterGender` ← Gender (M → MALE, F → FEMALE)
- `youngsterDateOfBirth` ← Birthday (convert DD/MM/YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD)
- `youngsterSchoolId` ← School name → fuzzy match against SCHOOL_LIST → store UUID
- `youngsterSchoolName` ← Matched school display name (for confirmation summary)
- `youngsterGrade` ← Grade
- `youngsterPhone` ← Student Phone (optional — omit if blank)
- `youngsterAllergies` ← Allergies (default "none" if blank)

`registrantType` = `"PARENT"` (hardcoded)

### Step 3 — Validate locally

Check each rule. Collect ALL errors before replying — do not stop at first error.

**Email:**
- Must contain `@` and a `.` after `@`
- Error: `📧 Email is not valid — e.g. name@gmail.com`

**Password:**
- Length 6–100 characters → Error: `🔒 Password must be 6 to 100 characters`
- No spaces → Error: `🔒 Password must not contain spaces`
- At least one lowercase letter → Error: `🔒 Password must include a lowercase letter`
- At least one uppercase letter → Error: `🔒 Password must include an uppercase letter`
- At least one number → Error: `🔒 Password must include a number`
- At least one symbol (non-alphanumeric) → Error: `🔒 Password must include a symbol e.g. ! @ # $`
- Not one of: password, password123, 12345678, 123456789, qwerty123, admin123 → Error: `🔒 Password is too common — please choose a stronger one`

**Phone (parent and student if provided):**
- Must start with `+` followed by digits only, minimum 10 digits total
- Error: `📱 Phone number must include country code e.g. +628123456789`

**School (per student):**
- Must fuzzy-match to an entry in SCHOOL_LIST
- Error: `🏫 Student {N} school not recognised — please check the school name`

**Per-student required fields:**
- First name, gender, birthday, school, grade must all be present
- Error: `⚠️ Student {N} is missing: {list of missing fields}`

**Student count:**
- Must be 1–5
- Error: `⚠️ Please register between 1 and 5 students`

### Step 4 — If validation errors found

Reply listing all errors, ask to re-send only the corrected fields:

```
❌ A few things need fixing before I can register:

{list each error on its own line}

Please reply with just the corrected fields, e.g.:
Password: NewPass#99
Student 1 School: Bali Island School
```

Do NOT save a state file. Do NOT proceed.

### Step 5 — If all valid: save state file

Write state file to `/opt/.openclaw-bsc/memory/registration_{SENDER_PHONE_DIGITS}.json`
Follow the schema in SKILL-BSC-REGISTER-STATE.md.

### Step 6 — Show confirmation summary

```
✅ Please review before I register your family:

👨‍👩‍👧 Family: {parentLastName}
👤 Parent: {parentFirstName} {parentLastName}
📧 Email: {parentEmail}
📱 Phone: {parentMobileNumber}
🔒 Password: set ✓

🎓 Student 1 — {youngsterFirstName} {parentLastName}
   Gender: {Male/Female}
   Birthday: {DD Mon YYYY}
   School: {youngsterSchoolName}
   Grade: {grade}
   Allergies: {allergies}

{repeat for each student}

Reply *YES* to register or *NO* to cancel.
```

---

## TURN 3A — Parent replies YES: Submit

### Step 1 — Read state file
Read `/opt/.openclaw-bsc/memory/registration_{PHONE}.json`
Check expiry — if expired, delete file and reply:
> ⏰ Your registration session has expired. Please send the registration form again to start over.

### Step 2 — Call registration API

```
curl -s -X POST https://schoolcatering.gaiada1.online/api/v1/auth/register/youngsters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{FULL PAYLOAD FROM STATE FILE}'
```

No auth token required — this is a public endpoint.

### Step 3 — On success

Delete state file.

Reply:
```
🎉 Welcome to Blossom School Catering, {parentFirstName}!

Your family account has been created.

👤 Your login username: {parentUsername}
🎓 Student username(s):
   • {student1FirstName}: {student1Username}
   {repeat for each student}

🔒 Use the password you set to log in.

You can manage orders and view the full menu at:
https://blossomcatering.online/

Enjoy! 🍽️
```

### Step 4 — On API error

Keep state file (allow retry on YES again).

Map error to friendly message:

| API error | Reply |
|---|---|
| `phone.*already.*registered` or `phone.*unique` | ❌ That phone number is already registered. Log in at https://blossomcatering.online/ or contact support. |
| `email.*already.*registered` or `email.*unique` | ❌ That email address is already in use. Please reply with a different email: `Email: new@email.com` |
| `password.*policy` or `password.*weak` | ❌ Password does not meet requirements. Please reply with a stronger password: `Password: NewPass#99` |
| `school.*not found` | ❌ One of the schools was not recognised. Please check and reply with the school name again. |
| `Missing required` | ❌ Some required fields are missing. Please send the registration form again. |
| anything else | ❌ Registration failed — {raw API message}. Please try again or visit https://blossomcatering.online/ |

## TURN 3B — Parent replies NO: Cancel

Delete state file.

Reply:
```
Registration cancelled. No account was created.

If you'd like to register later, just say "register" and I'll send the form again. 😊
```

---

## Stale File Handling

If parent triggers registration intent (Turn 1) but a valid non-expired state file already exists:

Reply:
```
🔄 You have a registration waiting for confirmation.

Reply *YES* to complete it or *NO* to cancel and start fresh.
```

---

## Rules

- Never echo the password back in any reply or confirmation summary — always show `set ✓`
- Never expose internal field names, UUIDs, or API paths in replies
- Never call the registration API without a confirmed YES from the sender
- State files are temporary — always delete after use (success, cancel, or expiry)
- `registrantType` is always `PARENT` for WhatsApp registrations
- Parent phone defaults to SENDER_PHONE if not provided in the template
- Student phone defaults to parent phone server-side if omitted — do not add it to the payload if blank
- School list is always fetched live at Turn 2 — never hardcode school UUIDs
- Follow SOUL.md output rules at all times — plain, direct, no internal reasoning in reply
